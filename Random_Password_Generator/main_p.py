# Eli Robison, Random Password Generator

"""
OVERVIEW:
Create a program that allows a user to specify password requirements (length,
upper/lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters) then gives them 4 possible
passwords they could use. 

PROJECT STEPS:
A main function that runs the code
Functions for the different password requirements
A function that assembles that password once it is the correct length
Users should be able to specify length and if they want to include:
    uppercase letters
    lowercase letters
    numbers
    special characters
HINT: You can make this by randomly selecting from different lists OR by randomly
generating the ASCII letters!
